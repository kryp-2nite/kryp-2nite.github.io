Application Name: Guess the Secred Word

Instruction
    you are presented a word represented by dashes. the objective of the game is to guess the word using the buttons on the screen. You have 7 guessed/lives to get the word right or else you lose the game.

Challanges: All of it was pretty hard but i think starting off on how i wanted the game to run was the hardest part.

Technology Used
    -HTML
    -CSS
    -JavaScript

Approach: the first thing i had to do was break down the game into small steps. like how is the game played, what is the rules of the game, how do you win/lose the game. once i brainstormed all that i then proceeded to start my project. it was very tough deciding where to start but with some help August i started my journey.

Challenges: Oh boy where do i start. some of the challenges i had was how to write the game out logically i was having issues with the letters showing when the letter was guessed right. Also i had issues with restarting the game where the letters that was guess needed to disappear. the way i over came these issues is by either googling it or getting help from August. she gave me a new motto to live by for coding, "Either its going to work or it is not".

Additional Information: i liked doing this project. it gets you to start thinking like a Software Engineer. Also wireframing is a good way to start anyproject you do.
